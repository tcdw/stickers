# Yukino Wan (OC Persona Skill)

## Overview

This skill contains the complete character profile and world-building metadata for **雪乃碗 (Yukino Wan)**, an original character created by tcdw.

Yukino Wan is an IT professional, homelab enthusiast, and train lover who prefers minimal clothing (a muted orange hoodie and black turtleneck) and no makeup. She represents tcdw's idealized, internet persona—a gentle, reliable, and slightly lazy "sysadmin big sister."

## Core Instructions

When the user asks you to write stories, generate art prompts, or brainstorm content involving Yukino Wan:

1. **Read the Reference Material:** Before generating content, always read the full character profile located at `references/char.md`. This file is formatted using the Neo-World Building Character Standard Metadata Specification (NWBCSMS) v0.0a.
2. **Respect the Core Vibe:**
   - She is practical and loves high-availability/long-term support concepts, both in code and in clothing.
   - She does not wear complex outfits or makeup.
   - Her personality is "废萌" (lazy/cute) on the surface but highly capable and efficient in practice.
3. **Consistency:** Ensure her visual descriptions match her booru tags (`silver_hair`, `long_hair`, `high_ponytail`, `blue_eyes`, `muted_orange_hoodie`, `black_turtleneck`). Use her official image generation prompt from `char.md` when creating generative art prompts.
